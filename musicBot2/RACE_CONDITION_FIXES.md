# Race Condition Fixes for Cache System

## Overview

This document outlines the race condition issues identified in the music bot's cache system and the fixes implemented to resolve them.

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Multiple Simultaneous Downloads of Same Song**

**Problem**: When multiple users request the same song simultaneously, they could all miss the cache check and start downloading the same song at the same time.

**Root Cause**: 
- Cache check happens before acquiring any lock
- Multiple processes could pass the cache check simultaneously
- Each process then downloads the same song independently

**Impact**:
- Wasted bandwidth and processing power
- Potential file conflicts
- Inconsistent cache entries

### 2. **File System Race Conditions**

**Problem**: Multiple processes trying to move the same file to cache simultaneously.

**Root Cause**:
```python
# Original problematic code
os.rename(original_file, cached_audio_file)
```

**Impact**:
- File move operations could fail
- Incomplete cache entries
- Orphaned temporary files

### 3. **Database Race Conditions**

**Problem**: Multiple processes inserting/updating the same cache entry simultaneously.

**Root Cause**:
```python
# Original problematic code
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO audio_cache ...
```

**Impact**:
- Database constraint violations
- Inconsistent cache metadata
- Lost access count data

### 4. **Processing State Race Conditions**

**Problem**: Instance-specific processing flags don't prevent concurrent processing.

**Root Cause**:
```python
# Original problematic code
if voice_client.is_playing() or self.is_processing:
```

**Impact**:
- Multiple commands processing simultaneously
- Queue management conflicts
- Inconsistent playback state

### 5. **File Path Mismatch After Caching**

**Problem**: After downloading and caching a song, the Track object still references the original file path, but the file has been moved to the cache directory.

**Root Cause**:
```python
# Original problematic code
# File gets moved to cache directory
await cache_manager.add_to_cache(...)

# But Track object still has original filename
return Track(filename=unique_filename, ...)  # File no longer exists here
```

**Impact**:
- "Audio file not found" errors when trying to play cached songs
- Tracks reference non-existent files
- Cache system appears broken to users

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Global Download Locks**

**File**: `music/player.py`

**Solution**: Added YouTube ID-specific locks to prevent simultaneous downloads of the same song.

```python
# Global lock to prevent race conditions when downloading the same song
_download_locks = {}

async def download_track(self, url: str, requester_id: int, requester_name: str) -> Track:
    youtube_id = cache_manager.extract_youtube_id(url)
    
    # Create a lock for this specific YouTube ID to prevent race conditions
    if youtube_id not in _download_locks:
        _download_locks[youtube_id] = asyncio.Lock()
    
    async with _download_locks[youtube_id]:
        # Check cache first (double-check after acquiring lock)
        cached_song = await cache_manager.get_cached_song(url)
        if cached_song:
            return Track(...)
        
        # Download and cache logic...
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents multiple downloads of the same song
- Ensures cache consistency
- Reduces bandwidth usage

### 2. **Atomic File Operations**

**File**: `utils/cache_manager.py`

**Solution**: Implemented atomic file move operations using temporary files.

```python
# Use atomic move operation
if os.path.exists(original_file):
    # Create a temporary file first to avoid race conditions
    temp_audio_file = f"{cached_audio_file}.tmp"
    os.rename(original_file, temp_audio_file)
    
    # Now move to final location
    if os.path.exists(cached_audio_file):
        # If file already exists, remove the temp file
        os.remove(temp_audio_file)
        logger.warning(f"Cache file already exists: {cached_audio_file}")
    else:
        os.rename(temp_audio_file, cached_audio_file)
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents file system race conditions
- Ensures atomic file operations
- Better error handling and cleanup

### 3. **Database Transaction Handling**

**File**: `utils/database.py`

**Solution**: Implemented proper transaction handling with explicit checks for existing entries.

```python
def _add_cached_song():
    with sqlite3.connect(self.db_path) as conn:
        # Use a transaction to ensure atomicity
        conn.execute("BEGIN TRANSACTION")
        try:
            # Check if entry already exists to avoid race conditions
            cursor = conn.execute("SELECT youtube_id FROM audio_cache WHERE youtube_id = ?", (youtube_id,))
            if cursor.fetchone():
                # Entry already exists, update it instead
                conn.execute("UPDATE audio_cache SET ... WHERE youtube_id = ?", ...)
            else:
                # Insert new entry
                conn.execute("INSERT INTO audio_cache ...", ...)
            
            conn.commit()
        except Exception as e:
            conn.rollback()
            raise e
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents database constraint violations
- Maintains data consistency
- Proper error handling and rollback

### 4. **Global Processing Lock**

**File**: `commands/music_commands.py`

**Solution**: Added a global lock to prevent multiple commands from processing simultaneously.

```python
# Global lock to prevent multiple commands from processing simultaneously
_global_processing_lock = asyncio.Lock()

async def play(self, ctx, *, query: str):
    async with ctx.typing():
        async with _global_processing_lock:
            # Command processing logic...
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents concurrent command processing
- Ensures consistent queue management
- Reduces state conflicts

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling and Retry Logic**

**File**: `utils/cache_manager.py`

**Solution**: Added retry logic for database operations and better error recovery.

```python
# Add to database with retry logic
max_retries = 3
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        await db.add_cached_song(...)
        break
    except Exception as db_error:
        if attempt == max_retries - 1:
            logger.error(f"Failed to add to database after {max_retries} attempts: {db_error}")
            # Clean up files if database operation fails
            if os.path.exists(cached_audio_file):
                os.remove(cached_audio_file)
            return False
        else:
            logger.warning(f"Database operation failed, retrying... ({attempt + 1}/{max_retries})")
            await asyncio.sleep(0.1 * (attempt + 1))  # Exponential backoff
```

**Benefits**:
- Improved reliability
- Better error recovery
- Prevents partial cache entries

### 6. **Fixed File Path References After Caching**

**File**: `music/player.py` and `utils/cache_manager.py`

**Solution**: Updated the cache manager to return cached file paths and modified the player to use them.

```python
# In cache_manager.py - Return cached file paths
async def add_to_cache(self, youtube_id: str, title: str, duration: int, 
                      original_file: str, normalized_file: str = None) -> Dict[str, str]:
    # ... cache logic ...
    return {
        'success': True,
        'audio_file': cached_audio_file,
        'normalized_file': cached_normalized_file
    }

# In player.py - Use returned file paths
cache_result = await cache_manager.add_to_cache(...)
if cache_result['success']:
    # Update filename to point to cached location
    unique_filename = cache_result['audio_file']
    
    # Update normalized filename to point to cached location
    if cache_result['normalized_file']:
        normalized_filename = cache_result['normalized_file']
```

**Benefits**:
- Fixes "Audio file not found" errors
- Ensures Track objects reference correct file paths
- Maintains cache functionality

## Testing Recommendations

- Test multiple users requesting the same song simultaneously
- Verify only one download occurs
- Check cache consistency

### 2. **File System Testing**
- Test rapid successive requests
- Verify no orphaned files
- Check atomic operations

### 3. **Database Testing**
- Test concurrent cache additions
- Verify no constraint violations
- Check data consistency

### 4. **Command Processing Testing**
- Test rapid command execution
- Verify sequential processing
- Check queue management

### 5. **File Path Testing**
- Test downloading and playing cached songs
- Verify no "Audio file not found" errors
- Check that Track objects reference correct paths

## Monitoring

### Log Messages to Watch
- `Cache hit for YouTube ID: {id}` - Successful cache retrieval
- `Added to cache: {title} (ID: {id})` - New cache entry
- `Song already cached: {title}` - Race condition prevented
- `Cache file already exists: {file}` - File system race prevented
- `Database operation failed, retrying...` - Database retry logic

### Performance Metrics
- Cache hit rate improvement
- Reduced duplicate downloads
- Faster response times for cached songs
- Fewer file system errors
- No more "Audio file not found" errors

## Future Improvements

### 1. **Distributed Locking**
For multi-server setups, consider using Redis or similar for distributed locks.

### 2. **Cache Warming**
Implement predictive caching for popular songs.

### 3. **Compression**
Add audio compression to reduce cache size.

### 4. **CDN Integration**
Consider CDN for cache distribution across multiple servers.

## Conclusion

These fixes address the core race condition issues in the cache system:

1. **Prevents duplicate downloads** through YouTube ID-specific locks
2. **Ensures atomic file operations** using temporary files
3. **Maintains database consistency** with proper transactions
4. **Prevents command conflicts** with global processing locks
5. **Improves reliability** with retry logic and error handling
6. **Fixes file path references** after caching to prevent "Audio file not found" errors

The system should now handle concurrent requests much more reliably while maintaining performance and data consistency.
